**Call Centre Analysis Dashboard (Excel)**

**Project Overview**

This project covers data cleaning, data analysis and data visualisation using Microsoft Excel. This project also aims to give insight into customer service data through an interactive dashboard


üìäData Visualization

A simple, well-detailed interactive dashboard report was created using a pivot chart. 
Then, slicers were inserted to filter the dashboard by Sentiment. 
Calculation was made to show the Total Number of Customers, Customers who spent over 30 minutes on calls and Customers who called more than once

‚ùì Business Question

ÔÇß	Analysis was carried out to show the number of people who called,

ÔÇß	Of all the listed reasons for calling, how many people had issues with payment?

ÔÇß	How many people called and spent over 30 minutes talking?

ÔÇß	How many people called more than once?

ÔÇß	How many callers for each sentiment 

üîç Key Insights

ÔÇß	Customer Response Time, Within SLA was greater than Below SLA and Above SLA. Which means most customers call more within the SLA

ÔÇß	Most Customers prefer a call centre to other available channels or Communication

ÔÇß	Los Angeles/CA has the highest number of Customer Call centres

ÔÇß	Among the Top 20 Customer cities, Springfield has the highest

ÔÇß	Customer call Days drop significantly on day 31

ÔÇß	California has the highest number of customers at the state level

ÔÇß	Most customers' rating was 0 (zero), followed by 5 (five)

ÔÇß	Billing Questions has the highest reason why Customer Calls




üí° Recommendations

Based on the insights above, I would recommend that:

ÔÇß	Customers should be encouraged to call within SLA

ÔÇß	More awareness or advertising should be done at the Chicago and Denver Call centres, as other states and cities with a low number of customers

ÔÇß	Customer call rating shows that 70% number of customers are not satisfied with the response they are getting from the service agent, 
especially Customers Calling based on a Bill Question, which also results in to increase in the number of Negative Sentiments. 
Furthermore, Billing (Billing Question) should be a priority as it has more Reasons for customers' calls compared to other Reasons. 
This can be said to have caused the high number of Customers rating 0 (zero) and Negative Sentiments.
